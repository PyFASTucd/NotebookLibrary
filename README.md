# Notebook Library
*A collection of Python tutorials and explorations*

Each tutorial or topic is in a Jupyter Notebook you can explore. The "mybinder" links can be shared to access these notebooks directly in your browser.

(For how to build a notebook, add it to github and share an interactive version on the web via mybinder.org, refer to this [post](https://reproducible-science-curriculum.github.io/sharing-RR-Jupyter/01-sharing-github/).)
